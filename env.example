## 🎬 The Core Philosophy: Cinematic Branding

We built BizForge around a three-stage "film production" workflow to make branding intuitive for everyone:

1. **Pre-Production:** You provide the "script"—basic inputs like keywords, industry, and tone.
2. **Production:** Our AI "crew" (LLMs and image models) generates high-fidelity assets.
3. **Post-Production:** You refine the output and export your polished brand materials.
